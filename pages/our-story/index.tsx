                        Snazzy Stones is a small home based business that specialises in high quality, handcrafted
                        jewellery made with sterling silver and natural gemstones.

                        A passion for rocks and minerals led me to study geology at Queenâ€™s University, and later
                        gemmology at the Gemmological Association of Great Britain (Gem-A) . That, combined with a love
                        of travel brought me to Snazzy Stones.

                        I travel to Mexico, Bali, and Poland where I get to personally meet local artisans and handpick
                        the jewellery that makes up Snazzy Stones. That way I can assure that all my items are of high
                        quality with beautiful stones.
